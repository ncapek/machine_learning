    "- Today in the online world things are moving too fast. Web behaviour must be responsive and there is too much data to handle manually. Updating actions based on data must happen automatically, hence the use of bayesian machine learning\n",

    "- Medicine\n",
    "    - A pharmaceutical company discovers a new drug for blood pressure and needs to find out if it works\n",
    "    - Then perform and experiment. Select 1 group to give the drug and a second group to give a placebo\n",
    "    - Measure the blood pressure of every person before and after their treatment and perform statistical tests to figure out if there is a difference between the groups\n",

    "    - A website wants to optimize the number of visitors who purchase something (conversion rate)\n",

    "        - write down the likelihood of observing that data\n",
    "        - use maximum likelihood estimation to figure out the parameters (mean and variance)\n",
