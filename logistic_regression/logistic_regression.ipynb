    "- numeric data is good to normalize, ie. subtract the mean and divide by standard deviation, which makes the data have a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1. We normalize data so that transformations, such as the sigmoid function, will have a more pronounced effect. The sigmoid has the largest slope near 0 and gets very flat as input values get far away from 0\n"
